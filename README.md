# Dynamic-Hash-Table-C-
Dynamic Hash Table implementation in C. 

The purpose of the program is to search for duplicate entries in a mailing list and print those to standard output. The individual mailing entry is implemented in the file mentry.c . Then the file mlist.c uses the already defined mentry to create a dynamic hash table which is implemnted using an array of linked lists to store all mailing entries.

I have implemented a dynamic hash table that should be resizing when one of the “buckets” gets full (20 elements) by doubling the number of “buckets”.
There should not be any bugs or limitations of this program.
